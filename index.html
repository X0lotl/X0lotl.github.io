            <h1>Euromaidan and the Revolution of Dignity</h1>
            <p>
                Euromaidan or the Maidan Uprising, was a wave of demonstrations and civil unrest in Ukraine,<br>
                which began on 21 November 2013 with large protests in Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) in
                Kyiv.<br>
                The protests were sparked by the Ukrainian government's<br>
                sudden decision not to sign the European Union–Ukraine Association Agreement,<br>
                instead choosing closer ties to Russia and the Eurasian Economic Union.<br>
                Ukraine's parliament had overwhelmingly approved of concluding the Agreement with the EU,<br>
                while Russia had put pressure on Ukraine to reject it.<br>
                The scope of the protests widened, with calls for the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych and the
                Azarov Government.<br>
                The protesters opposed what they saw as widespread government corruption,<br>
                the influence of oligarchs, abuse of power, and violation of human rights in Ukraine.<br>
                Transparency International named Yanukovych as the top example of corruption in the world.<br>
                The violent dispersal of protesters on 30 November caused further anger.<br>
                The Euromaidan led to the 2014 Revolution of Dignity.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                During the uprising, Independence Square (Maidan) in Kyiv was a huge protest camp<br>
                occupied by thousands of protesters and protected by makeshift barricades.<br>
                It had kitchens, first aid posts and broadcasting facilities,<br>
                as well as stages for speeches, lectures, debates and performances.<br>
                It was guarded by 'Maidan Self-Defense' units made up of volunteers in improvised uniform and
                helmets,<br>
                carrying shields and armed with sticks, stones and petrol bombs. Protests were also held in many other
                parts of Ukraine.<br>
                In Kyiv, there were clashes with police on 1 December; and police assaulted the camp on 11 December.<br>
                Protests increased from mid-January, in response to the government introducing draconian anti-protest
                laws.<br>
                There were deadly clashes on Hrushevsky Street on 19–22 January.<br>
                Protesters occupied government buildings in many regions of Ukraine.<br>
                The uprising climaxed on 18–20 February, when fierce fighting in Kyiv between Maidan<br>
                activists and policeresulted in the deaths of almost 100 protesters and 13 police.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, an agreement was signed on 21 February by Yanukovych and leaders of the parliamentary
                opposition<br>
                that called for the creation of an interim unity government, constitutional reforms and early
                elections.<br>
                Shortly after the agreement, Yanukovych and other government ministers fled the country.<br>
                Parliament then removed Yanukovych from office and installed an interim government.<br>
                This 'Revolution of Dignity' was soon followed by the Crimean crisis and pro-Russian unrest in Eastern
                Ukraine.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Public opinion about Euromaidan</h2>
            <p>
                According to December 2013 polls (by three different pollsters), between 45% and 50% of Ukrainians
                supported Euromaidan,<br>
                while between 42% and 50% opposed it.The biggest support for the protest was found in Kyiv (about
                75%)<br>
                and western Ukraine (more than 80%). Among Euromaidan protesters, 55% were from the west of the
                country,<br>
                with 24% from central Ukraine and 21% from the east.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In a poll taken on 7–8 December, 73% of protesters had committed to continue protesting<br>
                in Kyivas long as needed until their demands were fulfilled.<br>
                This number had increased to 82% as of 3 February 2014.<br>
                Polls also showed that the nation was divided in age: while a majority of young people were pro-EU,<br>
                older generations (50 and above) more often preferred the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and
                Russia.<br>
                More than 41% of protesters were ready to take part in the seizure of administrative buildings as of
                February,<br>
                compared to 13 and 19 percent during polls on 10 and 20 December 2013.<br>
                At the same time, more than 50 percent were ready to take part in the creation of independent military
                units,<br>
                compared to 15 and 21 percent during the past studies, respectively.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                According to a January poll, 45% of Ukrainians supported the protests, and 48% of Ukrainians disapproved
                of Euromaidan.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In a March poll, 57% of Ukrainians said they supported the Euromaidan protests.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                A study of public opinion in regular and social media found that 74% of Russian<br>
                speakers in Ukraine supported the Euromaidan movement, and a quarter opposed.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Public opinion about joining the EU</h2>
            <p>
                According to an August 2013 study by a Donetsk company, Research & Branding Group,<br>
                49% of Ukrainians supported signing the Association Agreement, while 31% opposed it and the rest had not
                decided yet.<br>
                However, in a December poll by the same company, only 30% claimed that terms of the Association
                Agreement<br>
                would be beneficial for the Ukrainian economy, while 39% said they were unfavourable for Ukraine.<br>
                In the same poll, only 30% said the opposition would be able to stabilise the society and govern the
                country well,<br>
                if coming to power, while 37% disagreed.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Authors of the GfK Ukraine poll conducted 2–15 October 2013 claim that 45% of respondents believed
                Ukraine<br>
                should sign an Association Agreement with the EU, whereas only 14% favoured joining the Customs Union of
                Belarus,<br>
                Kazakhstan, and Russia, and 15% preferred non-alignment. Full text of the EU-related question asked by
                GfK reads,<br>
                "Should Ukraine sign the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, and, in the future, become an EU member?"<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Another poll conducted in November by IFAK Ukraine for DW-Trend showed<br>
                58% of Ukrainians supporting the country's entry into the European Union.<br>
                On the other hand, a November 2013 poll by Kyiv International Institute<br>
                of Sociology showed 39% supporting the country's entry into the European Union<br>
                and 37% supporting Ukraine's accession to the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In December 2013, then Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov refuted the pro-EU poll<br>
                numbers claiming that many polls posed questions about Ukraine joining the EU,<br>
                and that Ukraine had never been invited to join the Union,<br>
                but only to sign the European Union Association Agreement (a treaty between the EU and a non-EU
                nation).<br>

                    Using the Russian naval base at Sevastopol as cover,<br>
                    Putin directed Russian troops and intelligence agents to disarm Ukrainian forces and take control of
                    Crimea.<br>
                    After the troops entered Crimea, a controversial referendum was held on 16 March 2014<br>
                    and the official result was that 97 percent wished to join with Russia.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 18 March 2014, Russia and the self-proclaimed Republic of Crimea<br>
                    signed a treaty of accession of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol in the Russian Federation.<br>
                    The UN General Assembly immediately responded by passing resolution 68/262 declaring that the
                    referendum<br>
                    was invalid and supporting the territorial integrity of Ukraine; only Russia voted against the
                    resolution.<br>
                    However, it was not enforceable. Attempts to pass enforceable resolutions<br>
                    in the U.N.Security Council were blocked by Russian vetoes.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Separately, in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions,<br>
                    armed men declaring themselves as local militia and supported by pro-Russian protesters<br>
                    seized government buildings, police and special police stations<br>
                    in several cities and held unrecognised status referendums.<br>
                    The insurgency was led by Russian emissaries Igor Girkin and Alexander Borodai<br>
                    as well as militants from Russia, such as Arseny Pavlov.<br>
                    They proclaimed the self styled Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic<br>
                    which have controlled about 1⁄3 of the oblasts since then.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Talks in Geneva between the EU, Russia, Ukraine, and the United States yielded<br>
                    a Joint Diplomatic Statement referred to as the 2014 Geneva Pact<br>
                    in which the parties requested that all unlawful militias lay down their arms<br>
                    and vacate seized government buildings, and also establish a political dialogue<br>
                    that could lead to more autonomy for Ukraine's regions.<br>
                    When Petro Poroshenko won the presidential election held on 25 May 2014, he vowed to<br>
                    continue the military operations by the Ukrainian government forces to end the armed insurgency.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In August 2014, a bilateral commission of leading scholars from the United States<br>
                    and Russia issued the Boisto Agenda outlining a 24-step plan to resolve the crisis in Ukraine.<br>
                    The Boisto Agenda was organized into five imperative categories for addressing<br>
                    the crisis requiring stabilization identified as:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Elements of an Enduring, Verifiable Ceasefire;</span></li>

                    <li><span>International Status of Ukraine.</span></li>
                </ul>
                In late 2014, Ukraine ratified the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement,<br>
                which Poroshenko described as Ukraine's "first but most decisive step" towards EU membership.<br>
                Poroshenko also set 2020 as the target for EU membership application.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In February 2015, after a summit hosted in Minsk, Belarus,<br>
                    Poroshenko negotiated a ceasefire with the separatist troops.<br>
                    The resulting agreements, known as the Minsk Protocol, included conditions such as the
                    withdrawal<br>
                    of heavy weaponry from the front line and decentralisation of rebel regions by the end of 2015.<br>
                    They also included conditions such as Ukrainian control of the border with Russia in 2015<br>
                    and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Ukrainian territory.<br>
                    The ceasefire began on 15 February 2015.<br>
                    Participants in this ceasefire also agreed to attend regular meetings to ensure that the agreement
                    was respected.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 1 January 2016, Ukraine joined the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the European
                    Union,<br>
                    which aims to modernize and develop Ukraine's economy, governance and rule of law to EU
                    standards<br>
                    and gradually increase integration with the EU Internal market.<br>
                    In 2017 the European Union approved visa-free travel for Ukrainian citizens:<br>
                    entitling Ukrainians to travel to the Schengen area for tourism, family visits and business
                    reasons,<br>

                <h1>2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine</h1>
                <p>
                    Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022.<br>
                    Internationally considered a war of aggression, the invasion is the largest conventional<br>
                    military attack on a European state since World War II.<br>
                    It triggered Europe's largest refugee crisis since that war, with over 3.7 million Ukrainians<br>
                    leaving the country, and millions more fleeing their homes.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The invasion was a major escalation of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict that began in 2014.<br>
                    This conflict began with the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity, when Russia annexed Crimea,<br>
                    and Russian-backed separatists seized part of south-east Ukraine, starting the war in Donbas.<br>
                    In 2021, Russia began a large military build-up along its border with Ukraine,<br>
                    amassing up to 190,000 troops along with their equipment.<br>
                    Russian president Vladimir Putin espoused irredentist views, questioned Ukraine's right to
                    statehood,<br>
                    and falsely accused Ukraine of being dominated by neo-Nazis who persecute the Russian-speaking
                    minority.<br>
                    Putin said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had threatened Russia's security<br>
                    by expanding eastward since the early 2000s – a claim disputed by NATO – and demanded Ukraine<br>
                    be barred from ever joining the alliance.<br>
                    The United States and others accused Russia of planning to attack or invade Ukraine,<br>
                    which Russian officials repeatedly denied as late as 23 February 2022.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 21 February 2022, Russia recognised the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR)<br>
                    and the Luhansk People's Republic, two self-proclaimed statelets in Donbas controlled by pro-Russian
                    separatists.<br>
                    The following day, the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use<br>
                    of military force abroad, and Russian troops entered both territories.<br>
                    The invasion began on the morning of 24 February, when Putin<br>
                    announced a "special military operation" to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.<br>
                    Minutes later, missiles and airstrikes struck throughout Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv,<br>
                    shortly followed by a large ground invasion from multiple directions.<br>
                    In response, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy enacted martial law and general
                    mobilisation.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multi-pronged offensives were launched from Russia, Belarus,<br>
                    and the two occupied territories of Ukraine (Crimea and Donbas).<br>
                    Four major war theatres developed: the Kyiv offensive, the Northeastern Ukraine offensive,<br>
                    the Eastern Ukraine offensive, and the Southern Ukraine offensive.<br>
                    The Russian military has also carried out air and missile strikes far into western Ukraine.<br>
                    Russian forces have approached or besieged key settlements, including Chernihiv,<br>
                    Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mariupol, and Sumy, but met stiff Ukrainian resistance<br>
                    and experienced logistical and operational challenges that hampered their progress.<br>
                    Three weeks after launching the invasion, the Russian military had enjoyed<br>
                    more success in the south, while incremental gains or stalemates elsewhere<br>
                    forced them into attrition warfare, resulting in mounting civilian casualties.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The invasion was widely condemned internationally.<br>
                    The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution which condemned it and demanded a full
                    withdrawal.<br>
                    The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations,<br>
                    and the Council of Europe expelled Russia.<br>
                    Many countries imposed new sanctions, which have affected the economies of Russia and the world.<br>
                    Various countries provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.<br>
                    Protests occurred around the world; those in Russia have been met<br>
                    with mass arrests and increased media censorship, including banning the terms "war" and
                    "invasion".<br>
                    Numerous companies withdrew their products and services from Russia and Belarus.<br>
                    The International Criminal Court opened an investigation into allegations of Russian military war
                    crimes in Ukraine.<br>
